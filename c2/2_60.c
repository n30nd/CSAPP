/*
Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from 0 (least significant) to w/8 âˆ’ 1
(most significant). Write code for the following C function, which will return an
unsigned value in which byte i of argument x has been replaced by byte b:
unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);
Here are some examples showing how the function should work:
replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB) --> 0x12AB5678
replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB) --> 0x123456AB

    for(int i = len-1;i>=0;i--) {
        printf(" %x", p[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b) {
    // unsigned mask = 0xFF << (i << 3);
    // unsigned b_unsigned = (unsigned) b << (i << 3);
