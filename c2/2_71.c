// You just started working for a company that is implementing a set of procedures
// to operate on a data structure where 4 signed bytes are packed into a 32-bit
// unsigned. Bytes within the word are numbered from 0 (least significant) to 3
// (most significant). You have been assigned the task of implementing a function
// for a machine using twoâ€™s-complement arithmetic and arithmetic right shifts with
// the following prototype:
// /* Declaration of data type where 4 bytes are packed
// into an unsigned */
// typedef unsigned packed_t;
// /* Extract byte from word. Return as signed integer */
// int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum);
// That is, the function will extract the designated byte and sign extend it to be
// a 32-bit int.
// Your predecessor (who was fired for incompetence) wrote the following code:
// /* Failed attempt at xbyte */
// int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
// {
// return (word >> (bytenum << 3)) & 0xFF;
// }
// A. What is wrong with this code?
// B. Give a correct implementation of the function that uses only left and right
// shifts, along with one subtraction..

typedef unsigned packed_t;
